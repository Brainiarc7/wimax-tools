Changes in v1.3.96:

 - Use the netlink controller for gaining multicast groups knowledge.

 - Fix handling of ack/nlerr -- we don't need RP_RESULT anymore.

 - Remove deprecated libwimax interface, all clients should have moved
   to libwimaxll.

Changes in v1.3.97:

 - Move to use a single WiMAX family for all the adapters (following
   the kernel as requested by the community). Interfaces are now
   addresed with an attribute indicating the interface index.

Changes in v1.3.98:

 - Make callbacks seen by the user take a void pointer instead of an
   specific type that has to be wrapped.

 - Namespace cleanups.
